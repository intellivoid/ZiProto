ZiProto is a format for serializing and compressing data

*Written by Zi Xing Narrakas*


**DISCLAIMER:** This software is not safe in regards of the outputs it might produce, basing on Serialization Crash testing performed with large data. We don't recommend using this software in production enviroments.

**NOTE:** ZiProto is a *fork(?)* of the MessagePack serialization format. This software was taken in its entirety from https://github.com/rybakit/msgpack.php. We RECOMMEND using Rybakit's MessagePack library instead for production-related workloads and environments.
